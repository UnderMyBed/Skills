# Agent Playbook — read this first

You are one agent in a conductor-led fleet building or fixing a product — typically a reactive web
UI over a backend API, sometimes importing a read-only upstream dependency you don't own (a shared
engine, a vendored library, a sibling service's client). This playbook calls that dependency **the
engine**. This is the shared way-to-think and the failure classes these builds keep hitting. A green
typecheck and a clean `git merge` prove the code *compiles* — almost nothing else. Your job is to
close the gap between "compiles" and "works, connected, and honest."

**Then read your role file** — it carries your procedure, your report contract, and your role's own
failure classes: `implementer.md` · `integration-gap-auditor.md` · `correctness-reviewer.md` ·
`scout.md` · `design-steward.md`

## The prime test
For every control, value, state, and route you touch: **name the real, wired counterpart on the
other end.** If you can't name it, it's dangling.

## 1. Seams — trace both ends
- **control → endpoint**: does the button call a route that EXISTS and is mounted? Confirm the path
  and the request/response shape against the actual route definitions — never assume.
- **producer → consumer**: a rendered value needs something that produces it. A consumer with no
  producer renders empty forever (a section the docs swear is live, that nothing ever populates).
- **state → next-action**: every terminal / empty / error state needs a real exit.
- **new-impl → existing-equivalent**: see §4.

A disabled button whose backend already exists, a card with no producer, an endpoint with no caller,
a state with no exit — each merges clean and typechecks green. That is exactly how they hide.

## 2. Reactivity & lifecycle gotchas — the silent bug class
If your UI framework has reactive state and a server-state / query library, this class passes
typecheck and *looks* right. Types will not save you — check each one explicitly:
- **Close/reset on success**: a mutation's call-level success callback often fires BEFORE the
  reactive result updates, so the pending flag still reads `true` at that instant. Any close/reset
  guarded on `!pending` NO-OPs → the dialog stays open, fields never reset. **Close + reset
  UNCONDITIONALLY from the success path** (mirror a component that already does it right); guard only
  user-initiated Escape/Cancel/X on the pending flag.
- **Double-submit**: disable the submit control while pending. A non-idempotent action (creates a
  row, advances a state) + a double-click = duplicate rows, or a FALSE error on an already-succeeded
  action (e.g. re-issuing a state transition that is now illegal).
- **Invalidation keys**: a cache invalidation must match the EXACT key the surface reads, or the UI
  won't update.
- **Reactive derivations**: derived/effect values must actually track their reactive deps; never
  hand-sync a plain-variable mirror of server state — that's a desync bug waiting to happen.

## 3. Ripples — ask, don't assume
A considered "no" is a decision; an unasked question is a gap. Does this change need: a **docs** or
**marketing-site** update? Does **in-app copy elsewhere** now reference or contradict it (a docs claim
for the feature, a state that names an action, a number described somewhere)? Do **interrelated
features need to cross-link** to it (a new surface nothing points to; a sibling view that should
reference it)?

## 4. Reinvention — reuse the existing capability, don't fork it
Before writing any non-trivial implementation (ingestion, fetch, parse, a domain computation), check
whether an existing capability already does it — better. That capability is either **the engine**
(§9) or a well-known library. A narrower re-implementation that merges clean is the most expensive
drift: it looks done and silently loses coverage (a single-source fetcher standing in for a tiered
one; a byte-copied module that drifts from its live original). Import the existing leaf modules;
don't fork them.

## 5. No façades — fix-or-remove
A control we can't make real gets REMOVED, never left as a disabled stub or a "coming soon" badge on
a shipped feature. A feature the docs claim but nothing produces is the product lying. Ship it working
or ship it gone.

## 6. Honest + fail-loud
Real errors surfaced — no swallowed exceptions, no fake fallback, no fabricated or defaulted data on a
customer path. Empty / loading / error states real and distinct. Copy is directive, never apologetic.
**Wire the error detail through** so the specific message you wrote actually reaches the user — don't
leave a generic error component showing only a bland heading while your curated message is unreachable.
Never present machine output as fact without marking it a suggestion.

## 7. Prove the live seam
Typecheck + fixtures + "the diff reads right" is NOT a run. If a path has never actually executed
against the real backend on real data, say so — do not call it shipped. Drive at least one real,
adversarially-shaped input (a long title, unicode, a missing optional field) through any write path;
clean fixtures hide the truncation/encoding/missing-field bugs a real corpus carries.

## 8. Base integrity (implementers)
Work ONLY in your assigned worktree. NEVER rebase / reset / checkout / force to "fix" your git state —
STOP and tell the conductor. A blocked git command is a signal you're doing the wrong thing, not an
obstacle to route around. You build; the conductor owns all git plumbing and merges.

## 9. Engine boundary (if your project has one)
The upstream dependency the conductor authorizes — **the engine** — is read-only unless the conductor
explicitly hands you an authorized seam. Import its modules freely; never edit its internals, never
write into its caches or data stores.

## 10. Mirrored contracts — the source model is the truth; fixtures are not
When one component deliberately does NOT import another, some shapes get **hand-mirrored**: a
pass-through model restating an upstream model, an enum/literal vocabulary copied by hand, a front-end
type twin of a backend schema. These mirrors drift — and the drift passes review when it's checked
against GOLDEN FIXTURES, because fixtures only carry the shapes they happen to contain (no rare
variant, no optional block). **Golden-green proves golden-shaped payloads only; a mirror's contract is
the SOURCE model.** When you touch or depend on a mirrored shape, open the source model and diff four
axes:
- **field set** — a field present in the source but missing from your strict (reject-unknown-keys)
  mirror crashes on key PRESENCE whenever the producer serializes every declared key (many do, null
  at minimum) — not only when that field is non-null;
- **nullability** — the source's optional fields must be nullable in your mirror;
- **enum / literal value-set** — copy verbatim; a subset makes real producer values unrepresentable;
- **required vs omitted keys.**
Keep your strict-mode tripwire (it is what catches the drift, not the bug) and cite the source
`file:line` in a comment at the mirror site. This class ends structurally — a generated mirror or a
parity test — but until then the source-diff is a named step, never a hope.

---
Your role file defines your report contract. Universal norms: findings are ranked, cite
`file:line`, carry a severity, and are REAL (no style nits, no padding); a verified "clean" is a
first-class result; verify against the real artifact — routes, callers, the source model — never the
diff's own comments; your final message IS the report.
