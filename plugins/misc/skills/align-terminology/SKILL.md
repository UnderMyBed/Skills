# Align Terminology

For every field, model, and enum value: **would someone who works with this data daily recognize the name without explanation?**

## The Expert Test

> If a specialist in this data's domain looked at field `Y`, would I have to explain what it means — or would they already know from the name?

If you'd explain it, you named it wrong. The name is an instruction — to the LLM, the developer, and the expert reading it. A name that carries its definition from an established standard beats one you invented.

## Why This Matters

1. **LLMs already know standard terms.** `status_code: 404` triggers HTTP semantics from training; `error_num: 404` forces the model to guess your convention.
2. **Experts validate faster.** The standard term reads instantly; a home-rolled synonym forces "is this the same as X?"
3. **Invented names drift.** `quality_score` sounds clear until someone asks "by what measure?" — a standard name would have disambiguated it.

## Process

### 1. Identify the authority

Most concepts already have a name somewhere:

| Kind of concept | Where authority lives |
|---|---|
| Cross-domain primitives (time, money, geography, identity) or data-interchange shapes | International or de facto standards (ISO, IETF/RFC, IANA, format specs) |
| Domain-specific concepts | The field's own standards body or reference vocabulary |
| Genuinely internal concepts | No authority exists — fine, if true (see Invented) |

### 2. Apply the Expert Test

```
Field: is_critical: bool
Authority: Syslog severity (RFC 5424) — an 8-level scale, not a flag
Expert test: "critical compared to what — 'error'? 'emergency'?"
Verdict: RENAME → severity: Literal["emergency", ..., "debug"]
```

### 3. Classify each field

| Status | Meaning | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Aligned** | Matches the authority's term | `content_type: "application/json"` (RFC 6838 media type) |
| **Misnamed** | Authority uses a different term | `is_critical` → RFC 5424's `severity` |
| **Conflated** | Standard's name, different concept | `content_type` used for "topic" |
| **Oversimplified** | Standard is richer than the field | `is_authenticated`, alone |
| **Ambiguous** | Different standards disagree | `status` — HTTP code, or workflow stage? |
| **Invented** | No standard covers this concept | `quality_score` — if truly novel, document why |

### 4. Propose the standard name

```
❌ content_type: "faq"            → RFC 6838 already owns this name (media type)
✅ topic: "faq"

❌ is_authenticated: bool (alone) → OAuth/OIDC separate authN from authZ
✅ is_authenticated: bool
✅ granted_scopes: list[str]
```

## Output Format

```
[STATUS] field_name → Authority: term | Action
```
```
[ALIGNED] content_type → RFC 6838: media type | None
[MISNAMED] is_critical → RFC 5424: severity | Rename to severity
[INVENTED] quality_score → No standard found | Keep, document why
```

## Red Flags

| Thought | What's wrong |
|---|---|
| "Our name is clearer" | Clearer to whom? The LLM knows the standard term from training. You're the only one it's clear to. |
| "Nobody reads field names" | The LLM reads them as instructions; a recognized name extracts better. |
| "It means the same thing" | Near-synonyms often aren't — check if the standard treats them as independent before merging. |
