# Prior Art Discovery

## Overview

Before building anything custom, systematically discover what already exists. The cost of adopting an existing standard is almost always less than maintaining a custom one — and that's usually discovered too late, after the custom version is load-bearing.

## Two Different Reasons This Skill Fires

Most of the time, this is the simple case: **the user correctly knows what they need (X), they just haven't discovered the solution space for X yet.** No confusion, no deeper problem to excavate — just run the search process below and report back. This is the default. Don't go hunting for a hidden XY problem that isn't there.

The trickier, less common case is the **XY problem**: the user is deep in the weeds on their attempted solution (Y) when the real question is about a different root need (X). When they ask "is there a library for X?", ask yourself: **is X the actual problem, or is it an approach they chose for a deeper problem?** This matters because the two cases search differently — the simple case searches for X directly; the XY case searches for the root problem too, and may find something that dissolves X entirely.

## Spotting an XY Problem

The user is often exploring domains new to them and may not know the vocabulary well enough to ask the right question — that's a signal worth checking, not proof by itself. Don't automatically presume every question is an XY problem — most aren't — but ask yourself whether it might be. Apply the **5 Whys** at multiple stages of your thinking:

1. **Before searching** — Why does the user need this? Why that approach? Is there a deeper need?
2. **After brainstorming** — Why are we building this specific thing? Is there a broader solution that dissolves the problem?
3. **After results come in** — Why didn't the user find this themselves? Is the domain vocabulary different from what they'd search for?

If the root problem IS different from the surface question, search for prior art on BOTH — but lead with the root-level answer.

Example: User asks "is there a library for fuzzy-matching product names?" — the root problem might be "I need canonical product identifiers." Prior art for the root problem is a barcode standard (GTIN/UPC): once every product has a canonical ID, most of the matching problem disappears. Prior art for the surface question is a fuzzy-matching library (e.g. a Levenshtein/Jaro-Winkler implementation). The root-level answer can save months of work. But sometimes the user really does just need fuzzy matching — don't be patronizing about it.

### A specific, very common variant: premature specificity

The tell here is mechanical and easy to spot: **the user names a specific technique or algorithm, not a problem.** "Are there k-means libraries?" names an algorithm. The actual need is one level up — clustering — and the user may not know the full menu of options in that category well enough to know they picked the right one. K-means might be a bad fit for their data's shape; they can't ask about HDBSCAN, DBSCAN, spectral clustering, or Gaussian mixture models if they don't know those exist.

This differs from the fuzzy-matching example above: there, the root problem was a *different* problem that dissolved the surface ask. Here, the category (clustering) is already correct — the user just locked onto one member of it before surveying the others. The fix is also different: don't search for a different root problem, widen one level to a category-level survey/comparison first (this is exactly what the Prior-work agent in Step 2 is for), THEN narrow to libraries for whichever technique actually fits. Report the category-level finding even if the user only asked about the named technique by name — that's the whole point, they can't ask about an option they don't know exists.

## When to Use

- About to create a custom ID scheme, taxonomy, or controlled vocabulary
- Building a data model for a well-studied domain
- Implementing an algorithm that sounds like a solved problem
- User says "what prior art exists", "is there a standard for this", "should I use an existing library"
- You notice yourself designing something that feels like it should already exist
- Starting work on a new domain you haven't researched yet

## Process

```dot
digraph prior_art {
  rankdir=TB;
  "User describes what they're building" [shape=doublecircle];
  "Brainstorm from pretrained knowledge" [shape=box];
  "Launch 3-5 parallel web search agents" [shape=box];
  "Compile findings into comparison table" [shape=box];
  "Recommend: adopt / adapt / build custom" [shape=doublecircle];

  "User describes what they're building" -> "Brainstorm from pretrained knowledge";
  "Brainstorm from pretrained knowledge" -> "Launch 3-5 parallel web search agents";
  "Launch 3-5 parallel web search agents" -> "Compile findings into comparison table";
  "Compile findings into comparison table" -> "Recommend: adopt / adapt / build custom";
}
```

### Step 1: Brainstorm (you, no tools)

Before searching, dump what you already know. List:
- **Standards bodies** that operate in this space (ISO, W3C, IEEE, OASIS, IETF, or a body specific to the field)
- **Canonical identifiers** that might already cover this (e.g. DOI for documents, ISBN/ISSN for publications, UUID/ULID for opaque unique IDs, ISO 3166 for countries, ISO 4217 for currencies, GTIN/UPC for products)
- **Well-known libraries** in the user's language ecosystem
- **Established techniques** that solve this class of problem
- **Adjacent domains** that solved a similar problem (what did THEY use?)

Share this brainstorm with the user BEFORE launching searches — they may already know some of these and can steer the search.

**Scale effort to how settled the answer already is.** "Integrate with Stripe from Python" isn't a contested space with multiple viable contenders — it's a named vendor's own official SDK. If the brainstorm already surfaces a single, obvious, officially-maintained answer, don't run the full 5-agent machinery to confirm the thing you already know: check the package is current (name, PyPI/npm listing, last release, maintenance status), note it, and go straight to Step 4's ADOPT. Save the full search-and-compare process for the genuinely unsettled cases — where the category has several live contenders, or you don't already know the answer cold.

### Step 2: Parallel Web Search (3-5 subagents)

Launch subagents simultaneously, each investigating a different angle:

1. **Standards agent** — Search for official standards, specifications, controlled vocabularies. Query: "[domain] standard identifier", "[domain] controlled vocabulary", "[domain] ontology"
2. **Libraries agent** — Search for packages/libraries in the relevant language ecosystem. Query: "python [domain] library", "npm [domain]", check package registries (PyPI, npm, crates.io) directly
3. **Prior-work agent** — Search for survey papers, comparison studies, write-ups of the tradeoffs. Query: "[domain] survey", "[domain] comparison of approaches", "[domain] best practices"
4. **Precedent agent** — Search for how established projects solved this. Query: "how does [well-known open-source project] handle [problem]", GitHub repos with >1K stars
5. **Data sources agent** — Search for freely available datasets, APIs, registries. Query: "[domain] API", "[domain] registry", "[domain] database free"

Each agent reports: name, which declared requirements it satisfies, ID format, API/data access,
license, and adoption level.

### Step 3: Compile Comparison Table

Present findings as:

| Option | Weighted Must-Have Fit | ID Format | Access | License | Adoption | Fits Our Needs? |
|--------|----------|-----------|--------|---------|----------|-----------------|
| Standard A | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| Library B | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| Build custom | Full | Our design | N/A | N/A | Just us | ... |

### Step 4: Recommend

If a numeric comparison helps, define it before scoring: list must-have requirements, assign weights
that total 100%, and score every option against cited evidence. The thresholds below are a **default
decision heuristic**, not empirical cutoffs. A single disqualifying gap overrides the aggregate score.

One of three outcomes:

- **ADOPT** — Weighted must-have fit is at least 80% with no disqualifying gap. Use the option directly (call the library, map to its IDs, apply the pattern). Worth the upfront cost.
- **ADAPT** — Weighted fit is at least 50% but below 80%, with bounded gaps. Use it as the base, extend with a thin custom layer, and document what's off-the-shelf versus custom.
- **BUILD CUSTOM** — Weighted fit is below 50%, a must-have gap is disqualifying, or the domain is genuinely novel. Document WHY existing options were rejected so future work does not repeat the search.

## What to Search For (by problem type)

| Building... | Search for... |
|-------------|--------------|
| ID scheme / taxonomy | Controlled vocabularies, ontologies, thesauri, registries (e.g. ISO 3166 countries, ISO 4217 currencies, BCP 47 language tags, GTIN/UPC products) |
| Data model / schema | Existing schemas and vocabularies for the domain (e.g. schema.org, OpenAPI, JSON Schema, GraphQL SDL, an industry-specific data model) |
| Algorithm | Survey papers, textbook solutions, existing implementations on GitHub |
| File format | Existing specs (e.g. Dublin Core, RSS/Atom, EPUB, a domain-specific XML/JSON schema) |
| API design | REST conventions, GraphQL patterns, existing public APIs in the domain |
| Scoring / ranking | Established methodologies (e.g. graph-centrality ranking, Elo/Glicko rating systems, a domain-specific scoring framework) |
| Text extraction / classification | Pre-trained models, annotated corpora, shared tasks and benchmark leaderboards |
| A capability (parsing, matching, queueing, auth, retries...) | Established packages in your language ecosystem — check PyPI/npm/crates.io/etc. directly, not just web search |
| A technique for a class of problem (rate limiting, concurrency, caching...) | The named pattern for it (token bucket, optimistic locking, LRU/LFU) — search the pattern name, not your specific symptom |

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Searching only in your language ecosystem | Standards are language-agnostic. A library in a different language might document the best approach even if you're not using that language. |
| Dismissing a standard because it's "too complex" | You can adopt the ID scheme without adopting the full standard. Partial adoption beats full reinvention. |
| Not checking if the standard has an API | Many standards and registries expose free lookup APIs. Don't scrape what you can query. |
| Assuming nothing exists because you haven't heard of it | The user hasn't heard of it either — that's why this skill exists. Search anyway. |
| Stopping at the first hit | Multiple competing standards is common. Compare before choosing. |
